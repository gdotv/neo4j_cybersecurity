# Neo4j Kubernetes Data 

This is the data associated with the "How to Bolster Your Cybersecurity by Visualizing Attack Graphs with Neo4j & G.V()" blog post, which is itself an adapted version of [a previous dataset](https://securitylabs.datadoghq.com/articles/kubehound-identify-kubernetes-attack-paths/#sniffing-out-attack-paths-in-kubernetes) used by KubeHound.

The [neo4j_data.zip](https://github.com/gdotv/neo4j_cybersecurity/blob/main/neo4j_data.zip) file contains the data model and can be imported to the [Neo4j data importer](https://data-importer.neo4j.io/) directly. Alternatively, the nodes and edges are also stored in raw .csv format.
